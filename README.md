# Smart-Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-System
The Smart Energy Consumption Forecasting System is a full-stack platform that predicts electricity usage for households and industries using IoT meter data. Powered by LSTM neural networks, it provides accurate forecasting and flags anomalies such as sudden spikes in energy consumption. The system is designed to help utility providers, energy managers, and researchers monitor and optimize electricity usage efficiently.

Demo Accuracy: ~86%
